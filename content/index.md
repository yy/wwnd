## Why this book? 

This book focuses on the _practical side_ of network science — **working with
network data** — to provide a more practical guide for data scientists to use network science.

We hope that this book can help researchers in day-to-day tasks, starting from
the very act of conceptualizing networks through to sophisticated network
analysis, from exploratory analysis to statistical modeling and machine
learning. At the same time, we also aim to give data scientists a foundational
understanding of the tools, both mathematical and computational, at their
disposal. The breadth and depth of statistical methods we can now use on
network data is dizzying. We wish to take the prepared data scientist from
their base knowledge of mathematics and statistics forward on a journey through
the fundamentals of network data.
